    <!-- ## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

    In your own terms, define the following terms:
    
    - What is HTTP? 
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol: Protocol that determines how web browsers and servers communicate with each other.
    - What is a URL?
        Uniform Resource Locator: An address of the location of a site or other resource on the Internet.
    - What is DNS? 
        Domain Name System: A system that translates domain names to IP addresses; a sort of address book that uses 'Natural' language to translate the IP address the user is trying to access
    - What is a query string?
        It is part of the URL that brings user to a specific page, multimedia, or section of page, if it exists.
    - What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
        GET- retrieves data from a server
        POST- sends data to a server
    - What is an HTTP request?
        A request to a server from a user.
    - What is an HTTP response?
        A response from server to user.
    - What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
        Part of an HTTP request or response that transmits info about the content, cache control. examples: Accept, Server, User-Agent
    - What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?  
        1. Browser translates the name into an IP address using DNS
        2. Browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and a million other things)
        3. The server sends a response with a status code indicating success or some error, depending on the number that shows (ie: 200, 404, 500).
        4. Browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, other CSS and JS files, etc...)
        5. Browser makes separate HTTP requests for those additional resources and receives response from the server for each

    <!-- ## **Part Two: Practice Tools**

    1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
    2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*
    3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***. Visit the page in a browser. -->


    <!-- ## **Part Three: Explore Dev Tools**

    Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.
    
    Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.
    
    Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data. -->
